<!--<br> is a line break. Doesn't need to be closed since it doesn't hold anything
    Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. 
    Semantic tags are useful for SEO purposes because it makes sure search engines pick up on the important info in your website.
        <em>, <strong>, <nav>, etc
    Anything done for aesthetic purposes should be done in CSS.

<span> does not add any stylistic or semantic value. Use this element to wrap sections of text for styling purposes or
to add attributes to a section of text without creating a new line of content. It is similar to <div>, however div is used to as a container for other HTML elements. 
When both are used with CSS, they can be used to style the content within.

Classes vs ID

Classes can be applied to many things. Ids are for unique elements. ID is best to use when you are styling a single element on the page
and it is not likely that the same styles will need to be applied to other page elements in the future.IDs are easier to reference in html. For example, a button with an id
is referenced in javascript to open a page. 

classes and heading font(h1 class=...)
